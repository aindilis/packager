Using quilt in Debian source packages.

  • This page is aimed at people who want to make some changes to a Debian
    source package which is already using quilt.
  • The intention is not to explain quilt, but to offer some Debian specific
    tips

General information

documentation

  • If you want to understand how quilt work, install the package and read /usr
    /share/doc/quilt/quilt.pdf.gz
  • There is an extensive guide on quilt and packaging: Debian New Maintainers'
    Guide.
  • A comprehensive yet succinct tutorial on quilt, How to use quilt to manage
    patches in Debian packages, published by Raphaël Hertzog (coauthor of the
    New Maintainers' Guide above)
  • A How-To from the Debian Perl Group: Quilt for Debian Maintainers.
  • There is also a Quilt Tutorial (PDF), though dated (2006)

Basic concepts

quilt works with some directories : it creates a .pc/ and a patches/ directory.

Those directories can be created when you do

 $ quilt import some_package.diff.gz

Using quilt with Debian source packages

Situation: you have downloaded a Debian source package which uses quilt and
want to fix a bug and then submit a patch to the maintainers.

Using .quiltrc configuration file

Place a .quiltrc configuration file in your home directory with the following
lines. 

QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches
QUILT_NO_DIFF_INDEX=1
QUILT_NO_DIFF_TIMESTAMPS=1
QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS="-p ab"

Environment variables

Alternatively, you can add these lines to .bashrc. Otherwise, run them in your
shell or terminal before using quilt

export QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches
export QUILT_REFRESH_ARGS="-p ab --no-timestamps --no-index"

Basic quilt tasks

Making a new patch

The source code unpacked by apt-get source does not have patches applied.

First step: apply existing patches to the source

quilt push -a

to "push" all existing patches onto the source tree (when you build a package,
this is done by the build scripts)

Creating a new patch

quilt new myPatch.diff # this is the patch name

quilt add README # Where 'README' is the name of file you want to modify. You have to do that for all files you modify before you change them; one quilt patch can change multiple files

Now make changes to the source

Now, make your changes to the files added to the patch: edit it, or replace it
with an already modified file stored in a different directory.

Updating a patch with changes made to its files

quilt refresh #you can do this as often as you like

Finish your editing

quilt pop -a #this un-applies all patches so that the source returns to the downloaded condition

Editing an existing patch

quilt supports multiple patches, but you are only ever change one of them.

This is the patch last pushed.

To edit an existing patch, start by pushing it

quilt push myPatch.diff

Now edit it, and when ready

quilt refresh myPatch.diff   #note: command line completion may save you some typing

quilt pop -a
