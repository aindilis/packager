Debian Packaging

22/02/2003, Gürkan Sengün

Introduction
We will package mguesser for Debian. Knowledge about Makefiles, configure and shell scripting or C programming can be very useful. Man
and the manpages are also very useful. Also have a look at help2man. I want to guide you packaging mguesser from the beginning to the
end. Enjoy your stay.

What you will need
A development environment, some utilities and debhelper which we will install like this:

apt-get install binutils cpp cpio dpkg-dev file gcc make patch \
                dh-make debhelper devscripts fakeroot lintian \
                debian-policy developers-reference \
                man-db manpages reportbug
(or build-essential lintian debhelper dh-make devscripts fakeroot)

Setting up the environment, see www.linuks.mine.nu/conf/. Of course you fill in your email address and your full name and choose your
favourite editor, these settings is what I use:
export DEBEMAIL="gurkan@linuks.mine.nu"
export DEBFULLNAME="Gurkan Sengun"
export EDITOR=mcedit

Choosing software you want to package for Debian
For this course I have chosen mguesser, as I packaged it already and it is not too hard (single binary) to get you started. This should
give you an idea what it is like. For Debian the package

must be DFSG compliant
must have some public download place (usually http or ftp)
naming should be software-maj.min.tar.gz and unpacks into software-maj.min/

Packaging the software
First you need to get the source of the software. Then put it in some directory, I have it in /home/tar/dd/. There you unpack the
software, usually

tar xzvf software-2.1.tar.gz
cd software-2.1/
dh_make

dh_make will make a directory called debian/ with a few files in it. Now your task is to fill them. I usually start with control, then
edit copyright. There is also changelog, rules, dirs and more. In rules you will find alot of dh_* commands, they are all from
debhelper. Each of them has a manpage, please refer to man debhelper for details, as well as the Debian New Maintainers' Guide.

Read more about the Debian Policy Manual. Updating the debian/changelog is done with dch or debchange (it is the same).

When you think the thing is ready you can start building the package

dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc -us

When things are built you should check the package using
lintian -vi mguesser_0.2-1_i386.changes

If that says all is right (no Warnings or Errors). You can install it with
sudo dpkg -i mguesser_0.2-1_i386.deb

You must check if the program works. Also make sure the manpage is working.

From what I experienced I will most likely to have go through this several times.

Never forget reportbug, it will be your friend. When you package something from http://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/requested you can
close the bug too with <number>-done@bugs.debian.org. If you don't know what to package check orphaned packages.

Also helpful is looking at how other packages are packaged

apt-get source package

And talking with upstream is important, contact them by email.
