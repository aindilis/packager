>&#13;	A clustering is defined as:  a grouping of a number of similar
	things;  "a bunch  of trees";  "a cluster  of  admirers" [syn:
	{bunch}, {clump}, {cluster}].   RADAR's primary application is
	clustering   and  <SPAN

>  of
	target applications,  where application is a  unit of software
	which performs a possibly  useful function.  We are interested
	in having  redundancy and quality across  an orthonormal basis
	of novel applications that satisfy perceived needs.

>&#13;	RADAR is an architecture for properly distributing information
	to applications  which can  perform relevant functions  on the
	data  and return semantic  information which  will be  used to
	identify targets.  As the RADAR architecture helps to identify
	new systems, these systems  will be digested and packaged, and
	will  gradually  replace RADAR  modules  with more  organized,
	complex,  accurate systems.	
      </P

>&#13;	Knowing what  we do about formal mathematical  systems and the
	relation  between   system  complexity  and   problem  solving
	capability, we have  a basic model of growth  that is designed
	to maximize capabilities.   This model is necessarily complex,
	but basically  can be thought  of as making sure  that foreign
	applications of value are aquired and set up.  However we have
	a suboptimal substructural  problem - that is -  we don't have
	the ability  to access the right packages  immediately, and to
	do everything  in the way  we would like  to.  As a  result of
	this,  we  have developed  the  following methodologies.   The
	first is that we try to create a market for tasks that need to
	be done,  so that people who  would like to work  in this area
	have clear  indications of  what work needs  to be  done.  The
	second, and  the point  of this paragraph,  is that  a natural
	equilibrium is  struck in which a certain  amount of knowledge
	loss is  assumed, and  the structures are  grown incrementally
	and  forked frequently.   Fortunately, we  do not  suffer from
	state space explosion because the new architectural components
	solve  the  organizational problems  that  would  have led  to
	explosion.
