>&#13;	The  policy of  Predator is  to collect  and  use applications
	according   to   their   licenses  and/or   specific   written
	agreements.  A sophisticated license management system will be
	found-or-created to ensure that all software, indeed all data,
	is used in  accordance with its authors wishes.   We intend to
	formalize  the contents of  licenses so  that we  can formally
	prove  the  correctness of  the  software  use.  This  license
	extraction is already done in  a minor capacity, but seeing as
	this  is   critical,  this  capability   will  be  extensively
	developed.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Due to  bounded resources, we  are currently employing  a wait
	and  see  approach.  Our  planning  technology is  essentially
	unused, i.e. there is not even basic goal dependency analysis.
	This is a  major problem.  If we got this  done, we would like
	to then  focus on other  things, like adequately  planning and
	developing  the essential  software.   So, right  now, we  are
	simply  going with  an  approach to  create essential  systems
	mainly by  locating, installing  and testing them,  since this
	still provides greater code capability.
