>&#13;	So  far, here  are some  of  the tools  which have  been
	incorporated to give Predator its functionality.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Mainly it  is perl code.  We  have done some  UML modelling of
	the process, mainly the capabilities management.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Without a doubt, the next  few steps will involve semantic web
	technologies, mainly ontology tools.  The package state should
	be represented  ontologically.  Therefore, modules  will query
	the ontology system in order to make decisions.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	The process definition is important and we have not settled on
	what  this will  be.  Neither  have we  found  the information
	extraction system,  that is  capable of handling  diverse file
	types (such  as .deb and tgz,  pdf, etc.)  Wow,  that would be
	powerful,  wouldn't it?!  I'll  have to  look for  that.  Now,
	here is an example, one  would simply, using the current state
	of  our technology,  do  this :
      </P
><P
>&#13;	radar  search  -c  "information  extraction  system,  that  is
	capable of handling diverse file  types (such as .deb and tgz,
	pdf, etc.)"
      </P
><P
>&#13;	This command  would then begin a  capabilites matching search,
	by looking at the capabilities already listed in the ontology,
	and by initiating a new search with this specific criteria.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Lastly, there are numerous  Debian specific tools which do all
	the real work at  this point, including dput, debmake, dh_make
	dpkg-buildpackage,     cvs-buildpackage,    lintian,    linda,
	mini-dinstall, etc.
      </P
