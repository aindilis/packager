You must  install these packages (dput,  mini-dinstall).  Also install
apache.  Configure the  debian archive used by mini-dinstall  to be in
/var/www/debian.

Don't remember  how to get key  signitures working so  disable them in
the  conf files.  Don't  use the  default ~/.mini-dinstall  because it
doesn't work so good, copy the /etc one and fix it up.

dput -f -c ~/.dput.cf -u <hostname> <package_version>.changes

   MICRO RECIPE FOR PERSONAL MINI-DINSTALL REPOSITORY
   The following dput and mini-dinstall configuration works for the
   mainters of dput. For your convenience we have included a "local"
   dput target in the stock debian dput.cf which can be used with the
   mini-dinstall configuration below.
   For simplicity, we do not use the daemon mode of mini-dinstall. As
   mini-dinstall has rather flexible configuration options, you might
   want to consider reading the documentation yourself, but the file
   file below should work out of the box to implement most simple setup.
   After copying the configuration file below into your home directory
   do mkdir -p public_html/debian ; mini-dinstall --batch
   in your home directory to setup your repository.

   ~/.mini-dinstall.conf:
   # Adapted Colin's mini-dinstall.conf
   [DEFAULT]
   architectures = all, i386
   archivedir = ~/public_html/debian/
   use_dnotify = 0
   verify_sigs = 0
   extra_keyrings = ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
   mail_on_success = 0
   archive_style = flat
   poll_time = 10
   mail_log_level = NONE
   [stable]
   [testing]
   [unstable]

If you get the error "No  host localhost found in config", then simply
use local as the host.  Also  update the site to not be ~/public_html,
but to be /var/www/debian.

Lastly, use this line in /etc/apt/sources.list

deb http://localhost/debian/ unstable/

To upload, use:
dput -f -c ~/.dput.cf -u local <package>_<version>.changes

Now just make your packages work!


If there are any problems with mini-dinstall, like:
